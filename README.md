## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **HTML / CSS / JavaScript** — static site, no build step
- **Leaflet.js** — interactive maps
- **GeoJSON** — boundary data


## ⚠️ Notes

- This is a **volunteer-only tool**, not a public-facing production website.

- Paths are relative to `/volunteer-toolkit-website/` for GitHub Pages.
